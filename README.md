### Clock in/out for Codam!

This simple android app can clock you in and out, count the hours daily and sum them up weekly.

It makes sure you have fulfilled your 25hours/week commitment to Codam, if you have scholarship.

You can take a smoke break by pressing the button 'Break' to pause the counting of time without clocking out.

If you clocked-out accidentally, you can clock-in again, and the calculation for the day will resume.

At the end of the week, the app will automatically reset, or you can manually reset it.

The app is still developing so come back for updates!
